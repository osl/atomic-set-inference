Building the Project
====================

* Download the TSP benchmark `tsp.zip` from the
  [Data-Centric Concurrency Control project page](http://sss.cs.purdue.edu/projects/aj/)
* In Eclipse, use `File > Import...` to import the projects contained
  in the `tsp.zip` archive. This generates the projects `tsp`, `tsp2`,
  `tsp2-AJ`, and `tsp2-AJ-Translated`.
* Use `Project > Clean...` on the projects to rebuild them (if `Project >
  Build Automatically` is checked).
