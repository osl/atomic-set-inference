Building the Project
====================

* In Eclipse, create a new Java project called `collections`.
* Via the right-click popup menu, delete the original `src/` folder
  from the project.
* Use the `Source` tab in the `Java Build Path` pane of the project
  properties (`Project > Properties`) to add a new linked source
  folder that points to the `applications/collections` directory.
* If necessary, rebuild the project using `Project > Clean...` them
  (if `Project > Build Automatically` is checked).
* For comparison, import the annotated version of the Java collections
  framework: in `File > Import...`, choose `Existing Projects into
  Workspace` and select the `aj_collections.zip` archive.  The AJ
  annotated collections framework was kindly provided by Frank Tip.
* The imported project containing the AJ annotated Java collections is
  called `JUtil_All`.
